# This is the Faith and Technology Initiative
A project by Calvin University students to explore the intersection of technological creation and the ultimate Creator.

## Who are we, and what do we want?
We are a collection of students at Calvin University interested in the intersection between faith and technology. Our goal is to bring interest from students, faculty, and professionals regarding the roles that technology can play in a Christian life.

We believe there is deep connection between computing and faith. Though computer science seems more preoccupied with the world of technical details than the arts or sciences, we believe that the connections to Christian life are significant and deserve attention. As Christians, we see that there is danger in blindly accepting new technology into our lives. As computer scientists, we see the value that technology is able to bring to people's lives. We strive to encourage nuanced and ongoing conversations regarding the appropriate place of technology in the lives of Christians and the church.

It is our hope that our group and its engagement with these topics can serve as a breath of fresh air in the technology community. Through this website and our "Podcast Name" podcast, we aim to engage students and professionals and bring light to purposes and effects embedded in the hardware and software we create and use.
