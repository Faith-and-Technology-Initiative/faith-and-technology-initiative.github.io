	<h2>Who are we, and what do we want?</h2>
	<p>We are a collection of students, involved with the computer science and related 
	departments at Calvin university. Our goal is to bring renewed interest from students and 
	professionals alike regarding the roles that techology can play in a Christian life. </p>
	<p>As a group, we have noticed the lack of conversation around computing and faith. Other
	fields, such as philosophy, biology, and the arts, all have very pronounced intersections
	with Christian life, but finding such meaning in more abstract fields (like computer
	science, information systems, or mathematics) can be difficult.</p>
	<p>It is our hope that our group and its engagement with these topics can serve as a breath
	of fresh air in the techology community. Through this website, and our "Podcast Name" 
	podcast, we aim to engage the minds of both students and professionals and bring light to
	the deeper meanings behind the hardware and software we create and use.</p>
