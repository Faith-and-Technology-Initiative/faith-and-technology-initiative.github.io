	<h2>Who are we, and what do we want?</h2>
	<p>We are a collection of students at Calvin University interested in the intersection 
	between faith and technology. Our goal is to bring interest from students, faculty, and 
	professionals regarding the roles that techology can play in a Christian life. </p>
	<p>We believe there is deep connection between computing and faith. Though computer science
	is more abstract than the natural sciences or the arts, we believe that the connections to Christian life
	are significant and deserve attention. As Christians, we see that there is danger in blindly 
	accepting new technology into our lives. As computer scientists, we see the value that 
	technology is able to bring ot people's lives. We strive to encourage nuanced and ongoing conversations 
	regarding the appropriate place of technology in the lives of Christians and the church.</p>
	<p>It is our hope that our group and its engagement with these topics can serve as a breath
	of fresh air in the techology community. Through this website and our "Podcast Name" 
	podcast, we aim to engage students and professionals and bring light to
	purposes and effects embedded in the hardware and software we create and use.</p>
